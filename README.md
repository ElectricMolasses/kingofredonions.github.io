# bar-chart-project
LHL Stretch Project


New feature roadmap.
Title functionality that takes up some of the user defined height instead of adding to it, as well as resizing to fit font regardless of size.

Certain functions need to be split into smaller pieces for readability/debugging.  Notably the drawStackedBar function.

Bugs
Right now if you set the title with two bar charts on the page, it will change both.
