# bar-chart-project
LHL Stretch Project


## About
Bar chart generator that takes an array of numbers, as well as a js object to gen.

## Examples

## User-end API

## Features

## Issues and Bugs

Right now if you set the title with two bar charts on the page, it will change both.

Animation is causing bar shadow to pop over the labels, and then disappear once animation completes.


## Roadmap

Title functionality that takes up some of the user defined height instead of adding to it, as well as resizing to fit font regardless of size.

Certain functions need to be split into smaller pieces for readability/debugging.  Notably the drawStackedBar function.

Should add functionality to parse strings into the object provided they're JSON.  Unsure whether or not js can do that itself at the moment.
